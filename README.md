# LGEO
A basic lightweight geometry library.
## Todo list:
 - Add IO functions for Ray
 - Migrate some of the functions to their own Util file (such as error codes, helper functions, etc).
 - Add IO functions for helper classes and values (such as enum codes)
 - Build polygon2d class
 - (later) Build 3d geometry
 - Clean up and comment code.
