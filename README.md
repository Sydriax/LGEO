# LGEO
A basic lightweight geometry library.
## Todo list:
 - Flesh out functionality of lines, segments, rays, and rectangles.
 - Migrate some of the functions to their own Util file (such as error codes, helper functions, etc).
 - Build polygon2d class
 - (later) Build 3d geometry
 - Clean up and comment code (in progress)
